# Schemas for the validation of eLTER reports

This is the central repository for the schemas used to validate eLTER reports.

The Shiny app "validiraptor", used for online validation of reports, takes its schemas from here.
**Work on the schemas here**, not in validiraptor's like-named folder (which contains a snapshot of the schemas as of 2014-03-11).
